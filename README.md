# Strefa NGO

Strefa NGO (eng. NGO Zone) is a portal connecting non-government organizations with potential volunteers, members, sponsors, and partners.

In Poland, many organizations don't have enough funds or people with adequate skills to build their online recognition. We can see the troubles in many areas like the quality of the organization's websites (or even lack of them), the attractiveness of their visual communication, or their marketing actions' frequency and effectiveness.

We're creating Strefa NGO to provide each organization with a set of tools that allows it to build a unique online profile with a bunch of customizable sections. You can think of it as a page builder but with elements prepared especially for NGO needs. Each profile will be indexed by the internal search engine and categorized to be easily findable through our search system.

This way, we can create one marketing team that promotes the Polish third sector as a whole and then provide each site visitor with the organizations that perfectly matches his or her interests, goals, and aspirations. We can also have one team of designers and developers who will deliver high-quality features for all organizations with every deployment.

## Why is this project open-source?

- So if you find our project valuable, you can contribute and help us make it even better.
- So you can use our codebase if you see the need for a similar platform in another field or country.
- So there is one more real-world open-source application people can take inspiration from.
- So we can get valuable ideas and thoughts from developers visiting our project.
- So we have another motivation to keep the project's code the best quality possible.
